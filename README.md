# React Native App: Flashcards

## Project Information

### About

This is a React Native application that runs natively on iOS and Android and was the final project for the React Nanodegree by Udacity. The app allows the user to view custom flashcards, save decks, start and quiz, and more.

### Concepts

This app utilizes a wide range of technologies to create the user experience, some of which are listed below:

- React Native was used to construct the user interface
- Redux was used to store the data that was created and modified in the app
- AsyncStorage was used to store the data locally on the device
- StyleSheets and Flexbox were used to style the various components of the application
